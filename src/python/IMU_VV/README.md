# IMU_VV
Inertial Measurement Unit Verification and Validation

This repo is for: <br>
1) Creating and validating the IMU triggers for the payload mission sequence (e.g. determining takeoff, deployment, and landing) <br>
2) Testing the "derotation" as required by SIFT <br>
3) 3D Flight Path Reconstruction, building off of the work from https://github.com/VADL-2022/iPhoneMotion
